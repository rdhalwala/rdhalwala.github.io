        "  The data set we are considering working with is [Rat Sightings](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe). This data set contains information on rat sightings in New York City from 2012 to present day based on service requests made by the community. The data is from [311 service requests](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9). Each row is different rat sighting with a unique key, which describes the unique identifier of the Service Request and in theory a different rat, although there is no way to be sure. Some columns describe the address, the date, the streets, the landmark and the borough of where each rat was seen. There is also a column which shows when the service request was created. We can use this to divide rat sightings by month or year. We were interested in using this data set because it provides data that can be relevant when answering different questions, such as, “How have rat sightings been affected by the introduction of the rat czar Kathleen Corradi.” and “How have right sightings increased or decreased in different boroughs since COVID-19”. Some further data may need to be brought in to assess COVID-19 numbers in different New York City neighborhoods. Also, further data could look at the population of different neighborhoods, and whether certain neighborhoods make more 311 requests than others.\n"
